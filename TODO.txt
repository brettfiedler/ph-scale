TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

=========================================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

HIGH
- why is the scene messed up with RatioNode(...,{ strategy: 'canvas' }) ?
- performance of 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- set RatioNode.visible=false before it has a chance to create molecules, to reduce startup time
- interactive graph seems to be crashing on iPad

MEDIUM
- make linear scale wider, use larger fonts for ticks?
- need new icon for 'Custom' screen
- flesh out SubSupText (scenery-phet#29)

LOW
- values in graph indicators don't gray out when disabled because scenery.HTMLText doesn't support opacity
- nicer handles on graph indicators, match design doc mockups, perhaps use images
- test various multi-touch scenarios
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- port strings from Java
- TODO items in code

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper to scenery-phet
- BeakerNode to scenery-phet
- ZoomButton to scenery-phet
- toScientificNotation to phet-core

=========================================================================================================

DESIGN

Basics: Change color of 'Basics' pH display to match 'Solutions' and 'Custom'?

Solutions: How to indicate when values are off the scale of the Linear graph?

Solutions: color and 'look' of zoom buttons?

Solutions, Custom: Why are non-interactive graph indicators grayed out when their value is zero?

Solutions, Custom: Make pH probe look like it's in the solution? If so, we'll need to revisit
all colors to add transparency. And we'll need to reimplement the fluid the comes out of the dropper
and water faucet, so that they extend only to the surface of the solution.
