TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

=========================================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

HIGH
- Basics: add option to auto-fill solution to a specified volume when a solute is selected. Set this to 0L
  for ph-scale-basics, 0.5L for ph-scale
- Solutions: remove scale from pH meter, add a probe that extends to bottom of beaker
- Solutions: make collapse button on pH meter hide only the pH value
- Solutions: make beaker wider
- Solutions: auto-fill to 0.5L when a solute is selected
- Solutions: add 'Linear' option to graph, with zoom buttons
- Custom: remove 'Linear' option from graph
- Custom: remove dropper and drain
- Custom: use a fixed 0.5L of solution
- Custom: add probe to pH meter that extends to bottom of beaker
- Solutions: implement linear graph

MEDIUM
- performance of 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- flesh out SubSupText (scenery-phet#29)
- Molecule counts: '4.0 x 10^25' should be displayed as '4.00 x 10^25'
- rewrite PHUtils.toTimesTenString

LOW
- color and 'look' of zoom buttons
- values in graph indicators don't gray out when disabled because scenery.HTMLText doesn't support opacity
- nicer handles on graph indicators, match design doc mockups, perhaps use images
- test various multi-touch scenarios
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- port strings from Java
- TODO items in code
- factor out duplication in CustomGraphNode and SolutionsGraphNode, after the fate of 'Linear' graph is decided
- take advantage of DAG to reduce number of nodes allocated in LogarithmicGraph

PERFORMANCE
- don't update things that aren't visible (Molecule counts, Ratio, collapsed pH meter, collapsed graph)

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper
- BeakerNode
- ZoomButton to scenery-phet

DESIGN

Both: when graph is set to 'Quantity', it's possible to have indicator values 10^-19, which is below
the bottom tick, and below our 'zero' position

Custom: it takes awhile to change pH with picker, should delta be larger?

Custom: Are we implementing the Linear graph feature? It represents at least 30 hours of work,
and has several nontrivial design problems, as noted below.

Custom: When indicators are off the scale of the Linear graph, the mockups show that they are
placed next to the scale's upward-pointing arrow, their 'pointers' disappear, 'handles'
disappear (for H3O and OH), and they are grayed out.  I'm not at all convinced that
this is a clear representation that these values are 'off the scale'.  The bigger issue
is that if the H3O or OH handle is removed, then the user can't modify the custom solution.

Custom: Multi-touch problem with Linear scale. What happens if an indicator goes off the scale
while it's being dragged? This can happen if 2 indicators are being dragged simultaneously,
or if the 'zoom in' button is pressed while dragging.
