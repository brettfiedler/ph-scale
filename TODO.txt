TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- When changing solute, setting the volume to 100% solute has potential problems. The worst case is where we have 100% water,
  select a solute, then suddenly have 100% solute, that seems odd.  And cases where we have a diluted a solute are also problematic,
  we don't keep the dilution ratio, so we can't switch between solutes to compare dilutions.  And in general, I don't think it's
  at all obvious (unit you use the pH meter) what is happening when you switch solutes with a non-zero volume in the beaker.
- The only way to remove solute from the solution is to empty the beaker. Do we need a 'Remove Solute' button?
  If so, do we need to label the combo box as "Solute"?
- The 'volume' and 'pH' values are both important to the learning goals of this sim. Why is the volume indicator
  so tiny in the design doc? Why is the pH indicator so heavy-handed? In this version of the sim, I tried using a
  similar indicator for both values. Let's discuss.
- When the pH probe is not in a solution, the pH indicator jumps to '7' and grays out. I find this to be distracting,
  and I think it's also confusing. Perhaps it would be better if the indicator were simply hidden when the probe is not in solution?
- The wire connecting the pH probe to pH readout interferes with the drain faucet. I tried a few different schemes
  for wire behavior (control points), what's shown in this version was the lesser of evils. Live with it? Other ideas?
- pH meter wire interferes with drain faucet
- 'Water' doesn't look very good on faucet.
- Why are +/- zoom buttons on opposite ends of scale? Is this a workaround to keep the indicators from covering the controls?
- What are we going to do about 'ratio' representation? In addition to the color issue, there's no way we're going to draw 3000 dots interactively in JavaScript.
- I can't use sun.AccordionBox, is there any good reason why accordion boxes need to be different in this sim?
- No 'Neutral' label on '7' tick of pH meter in 'Solutions' screen?
- Tick labels on beaker: 1 & 1/2, or 1.0 and 0.5 ?
- Show '-' for 'no value' in pH meter, ala 'Concentration' and BLL sims?
- How many zoom levels for graph? For linear vs log? For concentration vs quantity?
- Is pH meter draggable in 'Custom' screen?
- Why are indicators points at positions on graph when they have no values?
- First experience with indicators is in 'Solutions' screen, where not interactive. Is handle enough of a cue to indicate they are interactive in 'Custom'?
- Does center bar in graph really need to be so different between 'Solutions' and 'Custom' screens? (shape, shading, numbering,...)
- Why does range of 'Custom' graph go below zero?
- Hide indicator on 'Solutions' pH meter when no value?
- Should expand/collapse button in for 'Solutions' pH meter hide the pH value, too?

HIGH
- pH meter for 'Solutions' screen
- read-only graph for 'Solutions' screen
- interactive graph for 'Custom' screen
- 'Molecule count' feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature

MEDIUM
- constrain pH and volume so that student computations match displayed values, as in Java sim

LOW
- factor out duplicate code/patterns in model & view for 3 screens
- multi-touch issues?
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
