TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- What are we going to do about 'ratio' representation? In addition to the color issue, there's no way we're going to draw 3000 dots interactively in JavaScript.
- Can we ditch the 'Linear' graph feature?
- flow rate of dropper (0.05 L/sec) is slower than faucets (0.25 L/sec), is that OK?
- grayscale test indicates colorblind problems
- graph expand/collapse labels are a bad idea, separates title from units, complicated implementation,...

11/19/13 DESIGN DECISIONS
- Custom: use same zoom levels as Java sim for Linear scale
- Will need to implement 2 totally separate graphs for log and linear. No shading on linear, and linear is wider.
- make linear scale go below zero so that we can fit '0' tick on the scale
- drop shadow on interactive indicators on graph
- put both zoom buttons at top of scale
- when beaker is emptied, try setting values in graph indicators to '0' and position them below 10^-16 (or position at '0' on linear)

HIGHEST

HIGH
- Solutions: log graph, not interactive
- Custom: interactive log graph
- Custom: interactive linear graph, zoom feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- gray out left or right title in graph's expand/collapse bar
- Solutions: make pH meter look more like design doc (discuss what this means)
- Solutions: maximize width of beaker
- shrink the 'Molecule counts' feature

MEDIUM
- constrain pH and volume so that student computations match displayed values, as in Java sim
- don't update things that aren't visible (Molecule counts, Ratio, collapsed pH meter, collapsed graph)

LOW
- rename 'solute' to 'stock solution' throughout?
- exponents look lousy, rewrite using scenery.Text?
- factor out duplicate code/patterns in model & view for 3 screens
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
- port strings from Java
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' label is a few pixels low on check box
- TODO items in code
