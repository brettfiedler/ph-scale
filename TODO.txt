TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- White background doesn't work very well, colors are washed out (milk), solute combo box doesn't 'pop'.
- When changing solute, setting the volume to 100% solute has potential problems. The worst case is where we have 100% water,
  select a solute, then suddenly have 100% solute, that seems odd.  And cases where we have a diluted a solute are also problematic,
  we don't keep the dilution ratio, so we can't switch between solutes to compare dilutions.  And in general, I don't think it's
  at all obvious (unit you use the pH meter) what is happening when you switch solutes with a non-zero volume in the beaker.
- The only way to remove solute from the solution is to empty the beaker. Do we need a 'Remove Solute' button?
  If so, do we need to label the combo box as "Solute"?
- Using alpha (transparency) modulation to represent concentration isn't working. The colors are totally washed out
  for heavily-diluted solutes. (The white background doesn't help.) I think we need to use opaque colors, and use a
  'color scheme' approach similar to what we did in 'Concentration'.  I can provide more details when we discuss.
- The 'volume' and 'pH' values are both important to the learning goals of this sim. Why is the volume indicator
  so tiny in the design doc? Why is the pH indicator so heavy-handed? In this version of the sim, I tried using a
  similar indicator for both values. Let's discuss.
- When the pH probe is not in a solution, the pH indicator jumps to '7' and grays out. I find this to be distracting,
  and I think it's also confusing. Perhaps it would be better if the indicator were simply hidden when the probe is not in solution?
- The wire connecting the pH probe to pH readout interferes with the drain faucet. I tried a few different schemes
  for wire behavior (control points), what's shown in this version was the lesser of evils. Live with it? Other ideas?
- pH meter wire interferes with drain faucet

HIGH
- constrain pH and volume so that student computations match displayed values, as in Java sim
- graph

MEDIUM
- 'Molecule count' feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- add color range for each solute, use opaque colors

LOW
- multi-touch issues?
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
