TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

=========================================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

HIGHEST
- RatioNode(...,{ strategy: 'canvas' }) is running out of memory because of the number of layers created by HTMLText
- see build-a-molecule.Molecule3DNode for example of using scenery.DOM and a properly-sized canvas
- performance of 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature stinks (plan on interviewing without this)

HIGH
- Custom: interactive graph indicators become non-responsive after using pH picker on iPad
- #1, problem with tap-to-dispense on faucets
- flesh out SubSupText (scenery-phet#29)

MEDIUM
- make zoom buttons larger and increase x-spacing?
- pointer areas are a little off for interactive graph indicators
- rename Basics -> Macro, Solutions -> Micro throughout code, images, GitHub (after names have survived interviews and team review)

LOW
- GraphNode layout code could be more robust
- values in graph indicators don't gray out when disabled because scenery.HTMLText doesn't support opacity
- test various multi-touch scenarios
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- port strings from Java
- TODO items in code

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper to scenery-phet
- BeakerNode to scenery-phet
- ZoomButton to scenery-phet
- toScientificNotation to phet-core

=========================================================================================================

DESIGN

Basics: Change color of 'Basics' pH display to match 'Solutions' and 'Custom'?

Custom: Students are not finding the handles on the graph indicators.
