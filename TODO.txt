TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- 'ratio' feature: performance and color-coding
- 'Linear' graph feature: can it be dropped?
- graph expand/collapse labels are problematic, separates title from units, complicated implementation,...
- Solutions: what should pH meter look more like?
- Solutions: screen is cluttered and crowded
- Solutions: interference between pH and volume indicators
- Solutions: difficult to align scales and inefficient use of vertical space with pH value display
- shrink the 'Molecule counts' feature?
- how do interactive indicators work with the linear scale?
- how do interactive indicators work with an empty beaker? (which is the initial state)
- is range of interactive indicators limited so that pH stays in range [-1,15] ?
- Custom: is it really OK that we can't directly change the pH value to see how the graph changes?

HIGHEST

HIGH
- PHUtils.toTimesTenString appears to be buggy, eg shows H3O concentration of '0.0000016' for 'Chicken Soup'
- add interactivity to H3O and OH indicators in Custom screen
- Custom: interactive linear graph, zoom feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- gray out left or right title in graph's expand/collapse bar
- vertically align pH and graph scales (pH=Log=Linear -> 0=10^-14=10, 14=10^0=80)

MEDIUM
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- don't update things that aren't visible (Molecule counts, Ratio, collapsed pH meter, collapsed graph)

LOW
- exponents look lousy, rewrite using scenery.Text?
- factor out duplicate code/patterns in model & view for 3 screens
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
- port strings from Java
- vertical alignment of formulas is off, HTMLText bounds issue, scenery#190
- consider moving 'basics' package to ph-scale-basics, ph-scale-basics#7
- TODO items in code
