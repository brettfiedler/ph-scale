TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- when changing solute, setting full volume to solute has potential problems
- the only way to remove solute from the solution is to empty the beaker
- using alpha modulation for concentration is problematic, need a 'color scheme' ala 'Concentration' sim
- use similar readouts for volume and pH?
- pH Scale indicator jumping to '7' when not reading a value is confusing, better to hide it
- why is volume indicator value so small in design doc, isn't it as important as pH value?

HIGH
- constrain pH and volume so that student computations match displayed values, as in Java sim
- graph

MEDIUM
- 'Molecule count' feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- add color range for each solute, use opaque colors

LOW
- multi-touch issues?
- labels on dropper are too big, and will be an i18n problem
- milk doesn't show up on white background
- combo box list doesn't show up great on a white background
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
