TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- is range of interactive indicators limited so that pH stays in range [-1,15] ?

HIGHEST

HIGH
- PHUtils.toTimesTenString appears to be buggy, eg shows H3O concentration of '0.0000016' for 'Chicken Soup'
- add interactivity to H3O and OH indicators in Custom screen
- Custom: interactive linear graph, zoom feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- gray out left or right title in graph's expand/collapse bar
- vertically align pH and graph scales (pH=Log=Linear -> 0=10^-14=10, 14=10^0=80)

MEDIUM
- change look of label that is 'on' for ABSwitch
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- don't update things that aren't visible (Molecule counts, Ratio, collapsed pH meter, collapsed graph)

LOW
- scale down the 'Molecule counts' feature?
- exponents look lousy, rewrite using scenery.Text?
- factor out duplicate code/patterns in model & view for 3 screens
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
- port strings from Java
- vertical alignment of formulas is off, HTMLText bounds issue, scenery#190
- consider moving 'basics' package to ph-scale-basics, ph-scale-basics#7
- TODO items in code

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ExpandCollapseBar
- OnOffSwitch
- ABSwitch
- ChoiceSwitch
- MovableDragHandler (ph-scale-basics#26)
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper
- BeakerNode

Design issues

Solutions screen:

With everything expanded, the screen is cramped and cluttered. Are we going to live with this,
or can something be done to alleviate this?

How do you want the pH meter to be changed? Specifically, how to deal with the expand/collapse
feature, while maintaining the desired vertical alignment of meter and graph scales.

Custom screen:

Is it really OK that we can't directly manipulate pH to see how it affects the graph?
This is a major feature that is present in the Java version. It's also a design style
(manipulate either side of an equation to see the effect on the other side) that is
present in other sims (e.g., Graphing Lines.) Our reason of removing it seems to be
primarily motivated by design problems, not by any information that tells us that this
feature is not important. So I think we should bring this up for group discussion one more time.

The default state of the beaker is empty. How do interactive (H30, OH) graph indicators work
when beaker is empty? Are they not interactive? Do they behave differently if graph is set
to 'quantity' vs 'concentration'?  Seems like you should be able to change the quantity of
an empty beaker, but not the concentration.

When graph is in 'quantity' mode, does moving the indicators cause solution to be added/removed
from the beaker? What happens when the beaker becomes full or empty?

Are we implementing the Linear graph feature? It represents at least 30 hours of work,
and has several nontrivial design problems, as noted below.

When indicators are off the scale of the Linear graph, the mockups show that they are
placed next to the scale's upward-pointing arrow, their 'pointers' disappear, 'handles'
disappear (for H3O and OH), and they are grayed out.  I'm not at all convinced that
this is a clear representation that these values are 'off the scale'.  The bigger issue
is that if the H3O or OH handle is removed, then the user can't modify the custom solution.

Multitouch problem with Linear scale. What happens if an indicator goes off the scale
while it's being dragged? This can happen if 2 indicators are being dragged simultaneously,
or if the 'zoom in' button is pressed while dragging.

Both screens:

Where to position the graph indicators when the beaker is empty? The mockups show them
disabled, with no values or pointers. In a previous meeting, we decided that this is incorrect;
their values are zero. But there is no zero tick mark on the scale. I am currently
positioning the indicators below the 10^-16 tick, which I think is potentially confusing.
Should we add a '0' tick mark below 10^-16? Do something else?…

When the beaker transitions from empty to non-empty, graph indicators jump to non-zero positions.
It's correct, but a little jarring, so I wanted to point it out.

Design of the AB-switch (concentration/quantity) at the top of the graph needs to
be revisited. For the time being, I've changed the expand/collapse title to 'Graph'
and moved the 'Concentration' and 'Quantity' labels next to the switch.

The 'ratio' feature will be too slow to be usable.

Will the 'ratio' feature have color-coding issues that affect usability?
