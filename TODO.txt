TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

=========================================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

HIGH
- try adding a bit of transparency to solute and water colors, so that pH probe looks like it's in solution
- animate auto-filling
- Solutions: implement linear graph
- performance of 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature

MEDIUM
- need new icon for 'Custom' screen
- flesh out SubSupText (scenery-phet#29)
- Molecule counts: '4.0 x 10^25' should be displayed as '4.00 x 10^25'
- rewrite PHUtils.toTimesTenString

LOW
- color and 'look' of zoom buttons
- values in graph indicators don't gray out when disabled because scenery.HTMLText doesn't support opacity
- nicer handles on graph indicators, match design doc mockups, perhaps use images
- test various multi-touch scenarios
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- port strings from Java
- TODO items in code
- factor out duplication in CustomGraphNode and SolutionsGraphNode

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper
- BeakerNode
- ZoomButton to scenery-phet

=========================================================================================================

DESIGN

Basics: Change color of 'Basics' pH display to match 'Solutions' and 'Custom'?

Solutions, Custom: Make pH probe look like it's in the solution? If so, we'll need to revisit
all colors to add transparency.

Custom: When indicators are off the scale of the Linear graph, the mockups show that they are
placed next to the scale's upward-pointing arrow, their 'pointers' disappear, 'handles'
disappear (for H3O and OH), and they are grayed out.  I'm not at all convinced that
this is a clear representation that these values are 'off the scale'.
