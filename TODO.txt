TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

=========================================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

HIGH
- move responsibility of creating 'custom' solute from Solution setters to LogarithmicGraph?
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- Custom: interactive linear graph, zoom feature

MEDIUM
- Solutions: vertically align pH and graph scales (pH=Log=Linear -> 0=10^-14=10, 14=10^0=80)
- change look of ABSwitch labels based on which one is selected
- Molecule counts: '4.0 x 10^25' should be displayed as '4.00 x 10^25'

LOW
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- scale down the 'Molecule counts' feature?
- exponents look lousy, rewrite using scenery.Text?
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
- port strings from Java
- vertical alignment of formulas is off, HTMLText bounds issue, scenery#190
- consider moving 'basics' package to ph-scale-basics, ph-scale-basics#7
- TODO items in code
- how to handle i18n issues with switch in graph's expand/collapse bar
- how to keep units switch centered above graph, it's currently 'eyeballed', not a robust i18n solution
- don't update things that aren't visible (Molecule counts, Ratio, collapsed pH meter, collapsed graph)
- nicer handles on graph indicators, match design doc mockups, perhaps use images
- rewrite PHUtils.toTimesTenString
- factor out duplication in CustomGraphNode and SolutionsGraphNode

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ExpandCollapseBar
- OnOffSwitch
- ABSwitch
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper
- BeakerNode

DESIGN

Both: when graph is set to 'Quantity', it's possible to have indicator values 10^-19, which is below
the bottom tick, and below our 'zero' position

Custom: it takes awhile to change pH with picker, should delta be larger?

Custom: Are we implementing the Linear graph feature? It represents at least 30 hours of work,
and has several nontrivial design problems, as noted below.

Custom: When indicators are off the scale of the Linear graph, the mockups show that they are
placed next to the scale's upward-pointing arrow, their 'pointers' disappear, 'handles'
disappear (for H3O and OH), and they are grayed out.  I'm not at all convinced that
this is a clear representation that these values are 'off the scale'.  The bigger issue
is that if the H3O or OH handle is removed, then the user can't modify the custom solution.

Custom: Multitouch problem with Linear scale. What happens if an indicator goes off the scale
while it's being dragged? This can happen if 2 indicators are being dragged simultaneously,
or if the 'zoom in' button is pressed while dragging.
