TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- Macro: Change color of pH display to match other screens?

HIGHEST
- RatioNode(...,{ strategy: 'canvas' }) is running out of memory because of the number of layers created by HTMLText
- see build-a-molecule.Molecule3DNode for example of using scenery.DOM and a properly-sized canvas
- performance of 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature stinks (plan on interviewing without this)

HIGH
- flesh out SubSupText (scenery-phet#29)
- #3 interactive graph indicators become non-responsive after a few uses on iPad (HTMLText)

MEDIUM
- pointer areas are a little off for interactive graph indicators (due to HTMLText incorrect bounds for values)

LOW
- GraphNode layout code could be more robust
- values in graph indicators don't gray out when disabled because scenery.HTMLText doesn't support opacity
- test various multi-touch scenarios
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- port strings from Java
- TODO items in code

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
