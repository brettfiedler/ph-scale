TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

=========================================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

HIGH
- Solutions: implement linear graph
- performance of 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature

MEDIUM
- need new icon for 'Custom' screen
- flesh out SubSupText (scenery-phet#29)
- Molecule counts: '4.0 x 10^25' should be displayed as '4.00 x 10^25'
- rewrite PHUtils.toTimesTenString

LOW
- color and 'look' of zoom buttons
- values in graph indicators don't gray out when disabled because scenery.HTMLText doesn't support opacity
- nicer handles on graph indicators, match design doc mockups, perhaps use images
- test various multi-touch scenarios
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- port strings from Java
- TODO items in code

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper
- BeakerNode
- ZoomButton to scenery-phet

DESIGN

Basics: Change color of 'Basics' pH display to match 'Solutions' and 'Custom'?

Solutions, Custom: Make pH probe look like it's in the solution? If so, we'll need to revisit
all colors to add transparency. And we'll need to reimplement the fluid the comes out of the dropper
and water faucet, so that they extend only to the surface of the solution.

Custom: When indicators are off the scale of the Linear graph, the mockups show that they are
placed next to the scale's upward-pointing arrow, their 'pointers' disappear, 'handles'
disappear (for H3O and OH), and they are grayed out.  I'm not at all convinced that
this is a clear representation that these values are 'off the scale'.
