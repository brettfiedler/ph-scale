TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- 'ratio' feature: performance and color-coding
- 'Linear' graph feature: can it be dropped?
- graph expand/collapse labels are problematic, separates title from units, complicated implementation,...
- Solutions: what should pH meter look more like?
- Solutions: screen is cluttered and crowded
- Solutions: interference between pH and volume indicators
- Solutions: difficult to align scales and inefficient use of vertical space with pH value display

HIGHEST
- derive solution color from concentration instead of pH (ph-scale-basics#34)

HIGH
- Solutions: log graph, not interactive
- when beaker is emptied, try setting values in graph indicators to '0' and position them below 10^-16 (or position at '0' on linear)
- Custom: interactive log graph
- Custom: interactive linear graph, zoom feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- gray out left or right title in graph's expand/collapse bar
- Solutions: maximize width of beaker
- shrink the 'Molecule counts' feature
- vertically align pH and graph scales (pH=Log=Linear -> 0=10^-14=10, 14=10^0=80)

MEDIUM
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- drop shadow on interactive indicators on graph
- put both zoom buttons at top of linear scale
- constrain pH and volume so that student computations match displayed values, as in Java sim
- don't update things that aren't visible (Molecule counts, Ratio, collapsed pH meter, collapsed graph)

LOW
- rename 'solute' to 'stock solution' throughout?
- exponents look lousy, rewrite using scenery.Text?
- factor out duplicate code/patterns in model & view for 3 screens
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
- port strings from Java
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' label is a few pixels low on check box
- TODO items in code

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ExpandCollapseBar
- OnOffSwitch
- ChoiceSwitch
- MovableDragHandler (ph-scale-basics#26)
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper
- BeakerNode
