TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

=========================================================================================================

IMPLEMENTATION

HIGHEST
- RatioNode(...,{ strategy: 'canvas' }) is running out of memory because of the number of layers created by HTMLText
- see build-a-molecule.Molecule3DNode for example of using scenery.DOM and a properly-sized canvas
- performance of 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature stinks (plan on interviewing without this)

HIGH
- flesh out SubSupText (scenery-phet#29)

MEDIUM
 - rename Basics -> Macro, Solutions -> Micro throughout

LOW
- get asset file from YY for screen icons
- GraphNode layout code could be more robust
- values in graph indicators don't gray out when disabled because scenery.HTMLText doesn't support opacity
- nicer handles on graph indicators, match design doc mockups, perhaps use images
- test various multi-touch scenarios
- ComboBox: add background color behind arrow button (sun#43)
- port strings from Java
- TODO items in code

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- ToggleButton (sun#32)
- DropperNode, Dropper to scenery-phet
- BeakerNode to scenery-phet
- ZoomButton to scenery-phet
- toScientificNotation to phet-core

DESIGN

Basics: Change color of 'Basics' pH display to match 'Solutions' and 'Custom'?

Basics, Solutions: Students are having difficulty using the faucets.

Solutions: Should linear graph always have an arrow head? Making it appear and disappear adds a variable
that doesn't need to be there.

Solutions, Custom: Why are non-interactive graph indicators grayed out when their value is zero?
    YY: Since the pH readout is also null (-), it makes sense that the corresponding graph would have a null readout as well
    CM: then should graph indicators read '-' instead of '0'?

Solutions, Custom: Make pH probe look like it's in the solution? If so, we'll need to revisit
all colors to add transparency. And we'll need to reimplement the fluid the comes out of the dropper
and water faucet, so that they extend only to the surface of the solution.

Custom: Students are not finding the handles on the graph indicators.
