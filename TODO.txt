TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- Should expand/collapse button on 'Solutions' pH meter hide the pH value, too?
- What are we going to do about 'ratio' representation? In addition to the color issue, there's no way we're going to draw 3000 dots interactively in JavaScript.

11/19/13 DESIGN DECISIONS
* - all: use color range scheme (like in Concentration)
* - all: change 'Drain Cleaner' color to toilet-bowl-cleaner blue
* - Basics: put 'body' around pH value on meter
* - Basics: gray out meter but leave it at most recent pH value
- create my own accordion box for this sim
- Solutions: no label on '7' in pH meter
- Custom: use same zoom levels as Java sim for Linear scale
- Will need to implement 2 totally separate graphs for log and linear. No shading on linear, and linear is wider.
- make linear scale go below zero so that we can fit '0' tick on the scale
- Hide indicator on 'Solutions' pH meter when no value
- drop shadow on interactive indicators on graph
- put both zoom buttons at top of scale
- when beaker is emptied, try setting values in graph indicators to '0' and position them below 10^-16 (or position at '0' on linear)

HIGH
- pH meter for 'Solutions' screen
- read-only graph for 'Solutions' screen
- interactive graph for 'Custom' screen
- 'Molecule count' feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature

MEDIUM
- color coming out of drain faucet doesn't match solution color
- constrain pH and volume so that student computations match displayed values, as in Java sim

LOW
- factor out duplicate code/patterns in model & view for 3 screens
- multi-touch issues?
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not
