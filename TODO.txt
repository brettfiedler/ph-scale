TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

DESIGN
- What are we going to do about 'ratio' representation? In addition to the color issue, there's no way we're going to draw 3000 dots interactively in JavaScript.

11/19/13 DESIGN DECISIONS
- Custom: use same zoom levels as Java sim for Linear scale
- Will need to implement 2 totally separate graphs for log and linear. No shading on linear, and linear is wider.
- make linear scale go below zero so that we can fit '0' tick on the scale
- drop shadow on interactive indicators on graph
- put both zoom buttons at top of scale
- when beaker is emptied, try setting values in graph indicators to '0' and position them below 10^-16 (or position at '0' on linear)

HIGH
- make OnOffSwitch change value (and thumb color) while it's being dragged
- milk: try vary pale gray or direct to faint blue
- when something is diluted enough to be ph=7, it should be water color (really?)
- Solutions: log graph, not interactive
- Custom: interactive log graph
- Custom: interactive linear graph, zoom feature
- 'H3O+/OH- ratio' feature
- gray out left or right title in graph's expand/collapse bar

MEDIUM
- molecule count for H2O should have a fixed exponent of 25
- constrain pH and volume so that student computations match displayed values, as in Java sim
- ditch 'solvent' in model and view, use 'water'
- adjust touchArea for check boxes

LOW
- exponents look lousy, rewrite using scenery.Text?
- factor out duplicate code/patterns in model & view for 3 screens
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
- English strings have been capitalized, translations have not

MIGRATE TO COMMON
- OnOffSwitch
- ChoiceSwitch
