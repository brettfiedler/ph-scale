TODO list for ph-scale (HTML5)

HIGH
- pH meter
- constrain pH and volume so that student computations match displayed values, as in Java sim
- graph

MEDIUM
- replace temporary PHMeterNode, delete associated images
- add color range for each solute, use opaque colors
- what should happen when solute is changed? should solventVolume and soluteVolume be preserved?

LOW
- multi-touch issues?
- labels on dropper are too big, and will be an i18n problem
- milk doesn't show up on white background
- combo box list doesn't show up great on a white background
- home screen and navbar icons
- lots of stuff copied from beers-law-lab, much of it tweaked slightly
