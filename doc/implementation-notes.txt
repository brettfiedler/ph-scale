'ph Scale' implementation notes

Since the 'ph Scale: Basics' sim gets most of its implementation from 'pH Scale', we chose to treat the 'Basics' sim
as a joist.Screen in the 'pH Scale' sim. The 'Basics' screen is visible if you run in development mode (add the '?dev'
query parameter to the URL.) This streamlined development somewhat, and we'll see how it affects testing and future
maintenance. Just know that all code in js/basics/ is specific to the 'Basics' screen.

All core model computations are in PHModel.

I find that I frequently need to change the rendering order and layout of nodes.
To make that easier, node constructors typically have this structure:

    function MyNode(...) {

        // instantiate nodes

        // set rendering order (addChild)

        // do layout

        // register observers
    }
